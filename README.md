# Void
Vulkan 3D driven game engine. For now the engine is here just for practice and is a side project. 

### Project goals
I want to make this project as simple as it needs to be. I've found that I've written a lot of game engine code in the past, and due to feature creep the code gets bloated. The worst part is the most complicated features, I need the least add the most bloat. 
The ethos of this project is to let the games I want to make really drive what is actually needed in the technology.
